// 1-11.a: How would you test the word count program?
// As a sanity check, feed in a small program that has a known number of words.
// Next, check for edge case of blank document.
// Then, check very large documents. Then, check documents filled with tricky words
// to try to uncover specific bugs.

// 1-11.b: What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
// Documents with illegal characters, or with literal representations of items
// that are normally escaped ("\\", "\b", etc.).
